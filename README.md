## Abstract

Rare items are desirable to collect and invest in because they have sentimental value, are unique and in limited supply, are priced according to the collector's satisfaction, and have a low or no correlation to financial assets returns.

However, due to the nature of this asset class, it is only accessible to a select group of collectors.

- They must be audited by a specialist or curator prior to collection.
- Because they require physical asset transfers and a custodian, investment transactions are restricted.
- They are experiencing liquidity issues (Rich Assets, Poor Cash) as a result of their billions of unique sku; the prices of some of these sku are either too low or too high to invest in.

To address this issue, we propose the AnyRare platform, a decentrailzed platform for the tokenization of tangible assets. This design is based on the [Continous Organization](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper) principle and the [Bancor Formula](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/token-liquidity/blob/master/docs/bancor-formulas/bancor-protocol-whitepaper.pdf) in order to incentive a benefit for all stakeholders.
